<p>Here you will find professional information about me as a developer.</p></p>

<p>This portfolio was coded with semantic html, and css styling that specifically fit accessibility requirements.
Boostrap CSS Framework was used for styling navbar, and responsive layout. The grid system was used for containers, rows, and columns to create a mobile responsive portfolio. File contains an ‘index.html’, ‘portfolio.html’, and ‘contact.html’.</p>

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<br>


<h3>Challenges with the Body Section</h3>
<h4>Portfolio Header<h4> 
<p>Portfolio header Link defaulted to the color in the stylesheet after a href was applied to the h2 tag.</p><br>
<h4>Solution</h4> 
<p>Added an inline style to the html <code><a href="portfolio.html" style='color:#072A82'>Portfolio</a></h1></code></p>
<br>

<h4>Responsive of Body Section</h4>
<p>Navigation and footer was responsive when the site scaled down to mobile size,
but the body section of the page didn't respond with the same flexibility.
A footer slide bar was added to accomidate, but took away from the beautification of the page.</p><br>
<h4>Solution<h4>
<p>There was more than one bootstrap container classes applied to the code. I removed two
from the "About Me" section, and the "Portfolio Section", and kept the one
in the navigation section. I then added padding, and margin styling in the css
of the body section.</p>  

<h3>Challenges with Footer</h3>
<p>Trouble setting footer to stay fixed at the bottom of the screen<p><br>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Added fixed styling to the CSS file</p> <br>
